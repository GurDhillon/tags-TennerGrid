# Tenner Grid Solver

This project is a Tenner Grid solver that can find solutions to grids with any number of rows. The solver is implemented as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with various constraints for the rows, columns, and cells of the grid. The Forward Checking and Generalized Arc Consistency algorithms minimize the size of the search space, greatly improving the performance of the solver.
